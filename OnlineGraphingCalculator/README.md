# Overview

This program allows the user to graph equations, save them to their profile, and view them later.

I wrote this software to demonstrate my understanding of Full stack development, specifically with React and Node.js.

# Web Pages

The program is made up of three pages. Sign Up, Sign In, and Home. Any user can graph equations on the home page, but equations can only be saved if the user creates an account and signs in. After signing in, the user can view all previous work saved to their account. They can also delete graphs they are done using.

# Development Environment

The backend API and Server were written with Node.js, express, and Javascript. MySQL was used to record user data. The front end was built with React.

bcrypt was used for password hashing, JsonWebToken was used for user authentication, and PostMan was used for testing the backend during development.
