# Overview

This tutorial teaches the user how to use Stacks, Linked Lists, and Binary trees in Python. Each section has a step by step walkthrough on how the data structure works, and how to implement it in code. The end of each section contains a coding challenge for the user.

I created this program to demonstrate my understanding of data structures and my ability to explain complex programming concepts clearly.


# Development Environment

This program incorporates Markdown and Python together and in separate files.
