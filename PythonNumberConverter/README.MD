# Overview

This is one of my First Projects. It takes a number as input in either Base 10, Binary, or Hexidecimal. It then displays the number in all three forms. 

I made this program to demonstrate my ability to problem solve and use functions in Python.

# Development Environment

This program uses only Python.

Visual Studio Code was used as the IDE
